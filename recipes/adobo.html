    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns. This is a chicken thigh recipe and it MUST be made with thighs – no substituting with chicken breast!</p>
