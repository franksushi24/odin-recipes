    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This recipe is adapted from "U.S.A. Cookbook," written by Sheila Lukins, an author of the Silver Palate cookbooks that were popular in the 1980s and '90s. If you're looking for an introduction to deviled eggs, this is the place to start: just eggs, mustard, mayonnaise, a dash of Tabasco and a festive sprinkle of paprika (or jazz things up with a garnish of chives). They are a simple and spectacular addition to a holiday table.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 to 2 dashes Tabasco sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Paprika, for garnish</li>
        <li>Whole fresh chives, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse eggs with warm water, and place in a small saucepan. Cover with cold water, place the pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Turn off heat, cover and let sit for 10-12 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Cool in the refrigerator, loosely covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Halve eggs lengthwise, and carefully scoop out yolks. Place yolks in a bowl, and mash with a fork. Add mustard, Tabasco, salt, pepper and snipped chives. Stir in mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Fill each egg white with about 1Â½ teaspoons of the egg-yolk mixture and dust the top with paprika. Arrange in a spoke design on a platter; garnish with whole chives.</li>
    </ol>
