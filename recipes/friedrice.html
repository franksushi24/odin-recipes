    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Growing up, our family had a tradition of eating lunch every Saturday at our neighborhood’s favorite local Chinese restaurant. And every single Saturday for lunch, I ordered the same thing — egg drop soup and fried rice, my absolute favorites. This restaurant set the bar high for me early when it comes to how amazing fried rice could be. Theirs was always perfectly al dente with slightly crispy edges, full of rich savory flavors, and loaded up with plenty of extra veggies, eggs, and whatever protein sounded good.

        After our favorite restaurant sadly closed over a decade ago, I spent years tinkering around with dozens and dozens of batches of fried rice, attempting to recreate a fried recipe that tasted as good as theirs. And while nothing will ever match the original in my book, this fried rice recipe that I’ve landed on is as close as I’ve come and has been my favorite go-to ever since. It’s surprisingly speedy to make, easy to customize with your favorite add-ins, and SO flavorful and comforting. Thousands of our readers have also made and enjoyed it over the years since. So if you’re looking for a good recipe to try, I hope you’ll enjoy it too.
        
        Let’s make some homemade fried rice!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cold rice</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>veggies</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>oyster sauce</li>
        <li>sesame oil</li>
        <li>butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Scramble eggs:</strong> Using a small pat of butter, scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them into small pieces as you go. Then transfer the eggs to a separate plate, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté veggies and garlic:</strong>Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.        </li>
        <li><strong>Stir fry rice:</strong> Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting to brown slightly.        </li>
        <li><strong>Remove pan from heat.</strong> And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and season.</strong> Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve!</strong> Then dish it up and serve nice and warm!</li>
    </ol>
